# Machine-Learning-Digit-classifier-in-R
For any given image with a digit written on it (handwritten), we calculate the pixel and analyse the info to predict what digit it could be. This is a classic example of machine learning by using some train data to predict the info for a set of test data.

The main purpose of this project is to conduct experiment to get familiar with the ‘h2o’ package. As we we know, there many machine learning R packages such as decision tree, random forest, support vector machine etc. The creator of the h2o package has indicted that h2o is designed to be “The Open Source In-Memory, Prediction Engine for Big Data Science”.
